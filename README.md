# prework-study-guide
A study guide for course pre-work.

# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

The motivation behind this project was not only to have a deeper understanding about the basic fundamantals of web development, but to be able to project what I have learned into a webpage. I built this project because it gave me a better sense of how HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript work. Notes on these topics are included in the website. The problem this project tackles is any doubts you or others may have about your ability to code, and that it is possible to learn with hard work. I learned that web devlopment is fun, and while I may not understand it completely the challenge will be rewarding in the end.
